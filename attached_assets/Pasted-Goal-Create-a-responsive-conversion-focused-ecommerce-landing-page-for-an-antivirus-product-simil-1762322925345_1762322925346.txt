Goal: Create a responsive, conversion-focused ecommerce landing page for an antivirus product (similar to Avast). Visual style should feel like Asurion (friendly, rounded cards, human-centric photography, clean grid, trust-first) but with Avast-style orange as the primary color.

Tech stack

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks) OR Tailwind if you prefer — but keep it lightweight and fast.

File structure:

index.html (landing)

cart.html

checkout.html

assets/ (icons, imagery; use royalty-free placeholders)

If vanilla CSS/JS: styles.css, app.js

Brand & UI guidelines (inspired by Asurion; colored like Avast)

Primary color: #FF7800 (Avast orange). Use for CTAs, highlights, progress, and price accents.

Layout: generous white space, rounded cards, soft shadows, large readable headings, friendly iconography, and human lifestyle photography with devices.

Accessibility: WCAG-AA contrast, semantic HTML, focus states, skip-to-content, ARIA for interactive elements, keyboard-only navigation.

Build these sections in this order; copy can be adapted from the points below.

Header (sticky)

Left: logo (text logo okay).

Right: anchor links (Features, Pricing, Compare, Reviews, FAQ, Support), CTA button “Buy Now”.

Cart page: Show plan summary, quantity/device toggle (if applicable), promo code box, subtotal, proceed button.

Checkout page (high-converting with upsells):

Step 1: Email + create account (inline validation).

Step 2: Upsell modal before payment: offer add-ons VPN, Cleanup, AntiTrack with short benefits and toggles; live price update. (These reflect Avast’s Ultimate bundle components.) 
support.avast.com

Step 3: Payment form (card fields, country, VAT).

Order summary: plan, term, add-ons, total, “30-day money-back guarantee.”
